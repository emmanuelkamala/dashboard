# Admin Dashboard
This is a frontend template for an admin dashboard. It can be connected with a backend and be used as dashboard for creating, adding, updating and deleting resources. I have created two sample resources i.e a User and a Product with their functionalities, but have also added other resources as a sample without their core functionalities.
